# Task
An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.
When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings.

# Summary
This is an auction site called "Auctioneer". 
It's an online marketplace specifically created for buying and selling fashion items through auctions. It offers a platform for users to bid on and sell a wide variety of fashion products, ranging from clothing and accessories to shoes and jewelry. The auction format allows for competitive pricing and a dynamic shopping experience, as well as it caters to shoppers with a keen eye for style and trends.
